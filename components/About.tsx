      Technology has been a significant part of my life since pretty much
      always. Stimulated by my father, my first contact with programming was at{" "}
      <Underline className="decoration-green-500">age 8</Underline>, back when
      webpages were just a lot of pretty tables and Adobe Flash (ActionScript)
      was all we had to make them interactive.

      Fast-forward to today and I&apos;ve had the priviledge of working at a diverse
      variety of projects and companies, ranging from seed stage startups to
      IPO&apos;d enterprises. Specialized in Node.js (Typescript), React, and AWS â€”
      but always open to using new stacks â€” I now have over{" "}
      <Underline className="decoration-green-500">
        8 years of work experience

      As a <Underline className="decoration-green-500">Tech Lead</Underline> at
      Z1, I pioneered the development of a digital bank, architecting and
      leading critical business products that{" "}
      <Underline className="decoration-green-500">
        reliably handled hundreds of thousands of monthly transactions
      </Underline>{" "}
      using serverless technologies. I was their very first hire and worked
      together with the founders to build out and scale both the product and the
      engineering team.

      At Pagar.me (a StoneCo company), I contributed to large-scale financial
      infrastructure, responsible for processing a massive share of Brazil&apos;s
      ecommerce TPV. There, I contributed to core payment processing systems as
      well as got the opportunity to work on prototyping new products, ranging
      from mobile applications to external APIs and SDKs.

    <Paragraph>
      I excel in remote and collaborative settings, delivering impactful
      solutions in software architecture, API design and infrastructure
      management. Passionate about innovation, I bring a unique blend of
      technical expertise, leadership, and business/product insights to every
      project.

      Technology has been a significant part of my life since pretty much
      always. Stimulated by my father, my first contact with programming was at{" "}

      Fast-forward to today and I&apos;ve had the priviledge of working at a
      diverse variety of projects and companies, ranging from seed stage
      startups to IPO&apos;d enterprises. Specialized in Node.js (Typescript),
      React, and AWS â€” but always open to using new stacks.
